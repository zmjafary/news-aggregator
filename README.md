## Installation Guide for News Aggregator

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine, as Laravel Sail uses Docker for local development.

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zmjafary/news-aggregator.git
   cd news-aggregator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   If youâ€™re using Sail, you can install Composer dependencies with Sail as follows:

   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail composer install
   ```

3. **Set up the environment**:

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set your environment variables.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Make sure to set your API keys for the news services in the `.env` file:

   ```env
   SERVICES_GUARDIAN_KEY=your_guardian_api_key
   SERVICES_NEWSAPI_KEY=your_newsapi_key
   SERVICES_NYT_KEY=your_nyt_api_key
   ```

4. **Generate application key**:

   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Run migrations**:

   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
   ```

6. **Run the command to fetch articles** (optional, can be automated):

   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan articles:fetch
   ```

7. **Start the server**:

   You can start your application using Sail:

   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail up
   ```

   This command will start the Docker containers for your application.

### Accessing Your Application

Once the server is running, you can access your application at `http://localhost` and `http://localhost/api/documentation` for SwaggerUI.

### Notes
- **Sail Commands**: Remember to prefix commands with `./vendor/bin/sail` when using Sail. This ensures you are executing commands within the context of your Docker containers.
- **Docker**: Make sure Docker is running on your machine before starting Sail.
